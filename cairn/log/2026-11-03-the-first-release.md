# The first release

Prepared quoted-printable-codec 0.1.0, the first crates.io release. simd-cpu moved from its git rev pin to `simd-cpu = { version = "0.1", default-features = false }` from the registry, in the manifest and fuzz/Cargo.toml, as crates.io refuses a git dependency: simd-cpu 0.1.0 was published first, and the lockfiles resolve it from the registry. mime-rs and vcard-rs, which pin this crate and simd-cpu by git rev, move to the registry versions together.

The manifest, package.nix and default.nix read 0.1.0, CHANGELOG.md has its 0.1.0 section and SECURITY.md supports 0.1.x. Dev-dependencies took `default-features = false` with the features the bench needs, and the benchmark tables moved from the README to benches/README.md, per the Pimalaya guidelines (readme-007). Doc comments and module headers were compressed to the guideline ceilings, with no code behaviour changed.

The repository gained the files of the Pimalaya skeleton it lacked: CONTRIBUTING.md (the testing commands moved there from the README), SECURITY.md, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md and cairn/verify.sh.

Capabilities moved: none.
